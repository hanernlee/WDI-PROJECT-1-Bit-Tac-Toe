# ABOUT THIS PROJECT

As part of the Week 3 WDI Program @ GA, everyone was required to create a game.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT

## Game Mechanics

There are currently two modes in this game:
- 1 Player Mode (default)
- 2 Player Mode

### 1 Player Mode
- Human Player is able to choose any starter Pokemon at any time of the game
- Human Player always start first
- Computer randomly selects an empty playable space

### 2 Player Mode
- Both Human Players are allowed to choose any starter Pokemon at any time of the game
- Player One always starts first followed by Player Two in the next round (alternating turns)
- Player One is always Purple
- Player Two is always Pink

### New Game
- Refreshes the rounds but does not reset the scores

### Choose Pokemon
- Allows Human Players to choose starter Pokemon

### Restart scores
- Resets scores of both Players to 0

### Mode
- Allows user to switch modes at anytime.
- Switching modes resets everything


## Final Thoughts
Overall, the project was very challenging but definitely worth the time. Perhaps at a later stage I will look into to creating a smarter AI. Special thanks to DT and Hugh for providing me with assistance!
